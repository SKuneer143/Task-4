# Task-4
Explains how passwords are stored using hashing and encryption, and why hashing is more secure.

Compares different hash types like MD5, SHA-1, and bcrypt, highlighting their security strengths and weaknesses.

Demonstrates how weak hashes can be cracked using dictionary and brute-force attacks.

Analyzes why weak passwords fail due to low entropy and predictable patterns.

Emphasizes the importance of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and strong authentication practices.
